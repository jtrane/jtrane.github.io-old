### Machine Ethics

If autonomous systems such as driverless cars, [humanoid robots](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/cool-robots/pepper), [killer robots](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/we-should-not-ban-killer-robots) or just any software agent make decisions that affect human beings, then they need to be designed so that they are able to make ethical decisions.

This subject raises both interesting social and technical questions and could be a potential area of collaboration.
