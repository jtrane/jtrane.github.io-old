### What are the contributions of logic in computer science?

specification languages (model theory) and reasoning (proof theory)

type theory

curry howard, intuitionstic logic

domain theory: information order (Scott topology) vs logical order

data bases: logical formulas as queries

modal logic (first order logic is too strong)

finite model theory (first order logic is too weak)

descriptive complexity

logic programming

knowledge presentation

model checking

sat solvers

smt solvers

structural proof theory

fuzzy logic, many valued logics

3/4 valued logics

belief revision

dynamic logic

Kleene algebra
