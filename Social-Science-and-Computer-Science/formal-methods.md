### What are formal methods in SC?

Here is a guess.

* differential equations (motivated by physics) 

* game theory (as in economics)

* agent based modeling, multi agent systems, cellular automata, Boolean nets, artificial neural nets, evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms

### What then about formal methods in the sense of CS?

- Mathematical Tools: (Time and Space) Complexity, Nondeterminism, Bisimulations, Parametricity, Coinduction, Fixpoints, (Co)Algebras, ...

- Software Tools: Sat Solving, Logic Programming, Model Checking, Theorem Proving, Functional Programming, Type Theory, ... 

- Problem Types: Compositional design and analysis of systems, Logical analysis of properties of systems
