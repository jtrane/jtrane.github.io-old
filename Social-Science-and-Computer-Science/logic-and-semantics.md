## Logic and Semantics

### some interesting examples:

* coinduction applied to infinite games [L](http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1185), [AW](http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4537)

* applications of functional programming to game theory: Higher-Order Game Theory ...  [EO1](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~pbo/papers/paper022.pdf), [EO2](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~pbo/papers/paper032.pdf), [EO3](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~pbo/papers/paper041.pdf) [Hetal1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01003) [Hetal2](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01002) 

* compositional account of game theory [Hetal3](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06061), [HG](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641)

* parametricity explains Noether's theorem in physics [A](http://bentnib.org/conservation-laws.pdf)

* Sandro Sozzo uses quantum logic and probability to explain human decision making. In CS many non-classical logics play an important role ... could some of them be applied to similar questions?

* ... ? 

### a somewhat arbitrary list just to indicate that it is likely that much more is possible

* specification languages (model theory) and reasoning (proof theory)

* type theory

* curry howard, intuitionstic logic

* domain theory: information order (Scott topology) vs logical order

* data bases: logical formulas as queries

* modal logic (first order logic is too strong)

* finite model theory (first order logic is too weak)

* descriptive complexity

* logic programming

* knowledge presentation

* model checking

* sat solvers

* smt solvers

* structural proof theory

* fuzzy logic, many valued logics

* 3 or 4 or many valued logics

* belief revision

* dynamic logic

* Kleene algebra

* ... ?
