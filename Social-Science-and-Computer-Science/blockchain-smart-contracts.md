# Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Smart Locks, etc

A [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_%28database%29) is a distributed database. It is the data structure used by [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) (2009)  to solve the problem of distributed consensus (who owns a coin?). 
This technology can be used for many other purposes.

* [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) (July 2015) provides a powerful programming language to write programs that run on the blockchain. They are called smart contracts. There are already a number of such Dapps:

* [Storj](https://storj.io/faq.html) (?? 2016) is a decentralised file storage system providing an alternative to commercial systems such as Dropbox.

* [Slock.it](https://slock.it/faq.md) (?? 2016) uses smart contracts to open real world physical locks. This may have huge consequences for bike and car and house sharing. Will Airbnb have disappeared in 10 years?

* [The DAO](https://daohub.org/) (May 2016) is set to be the first company run only by smart contracts (no CEO, no management, no employees). It is also the highest funded crowdfunding project ever (collecting more than 300x the target of half a million $.)

* [More Dapps ...](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ethereum+projects&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b&gfe_rd=cr&ei=u0hUV_yYE-vW8geU_ILAAg#q=dapps). 

[An article](https://medium.com/the-coinbase-blog/ethereum-is-the-forefront-of-digital-currency-5300298f6c75#.prlgtfnqx) explaining why Ethereum and its Dapps will change the world as we know it. (Think back to how the world was like before the first apps appeared.)
