A large part of CS consists in the engineering of computing artefacts. 

Programming Languages, Operating Systems, Data Bases, Distributed Systems, ...

Efficiency, scalability, reliability, security, ...

The main concern of CS is not to engineer these artefacts, but to develop methodologies which support the engineering of the artefacts that satisfy the quality requirements.

The mathematical foundations for this research are the subject of Theoretical Computer Science (TCS)

TCS is sometimes devided into

 * Track A: Algorithms, Complexity and Games (... analysing algorithms ...)

 * Track B: Logic, Semantics, Automata and Theory of Programming (... building systems ...)
