## State of the Art?

There is a long tradition of CS in SC (agent-based modelling, ...) and of SC in CS (HCI, ...). But there has been a surge of interest over the last decade.

[Physics mathematics vs computer science mathematics](physics-maths-vs-CS-maths) 

[Computer science](computer-science)

[Examples of research areas that overlap SC and CS](existing-research-areas).

These examples above illustrate the specific [contributions CS-maths can make](contributions-of-CS-maths) but emphasize more algorithms and complexity theory than logic and semantics. What could be specific [contributions of logic and semantics](logic-and-semantics)?
