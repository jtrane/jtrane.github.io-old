## State of the Art?

There is a long tradition of CS in SC (agent-based modelling, ...) and of SC in CS (HCI, ...). 

But there has been a surge of interest over the last decade.

[Examples of research areas that overlap SC and CS](existing-research-areas.md). These examples illustrate existing interactions between SC and CS, 
  - using CS-tools in SC
  - **applying CS-maths to SC**
  - arising from novel challenges posed by techonological CS-developments. 
  
The 2nd item is closest to my research expertise and so I would like to speculate on [physics mathematics vs computer science mathematics](physics-maths-vs-CS-maths.md).

CS-maths (or Theoretical Computer Science (TCS)) lays the foundation of [Computer science](computer-science.md). It is sometimes divided into algorithms and into logic/semantics, where I see myself in logic/semantics.

* **What are the [contributions CS-maths can make](contributions-of-CS-maths.md) and what are the more specific [contributions of logic and semantics](logic-and-semantics.md)?**

My own contributions have been helping to organise [events](track-record.md) in which these questions are pursued and a series of papers [coauthored with Balco, Frittella, Greco, Palmigiano, Sikimic](http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/akurz/works.html) aiming at making [dynamic epistemic logics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/de-logic/) applicable to SC (but the work itself is technical and in [proof theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory)).
