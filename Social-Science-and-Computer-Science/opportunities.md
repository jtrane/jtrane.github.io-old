## Opportunities

#### Joint supervision

* Start collaborations on the level of BSc/MSc projects. If any of you has a programming task that is suitable for such a project,
I am happy to be the supervisor on the CS side. 

* There can be other opportunities to get a CS student to work: 
Currently Kirsten Barrett from Geography is supervising a 
[NERC Research Experience Placement](http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/available/postgrad/advanced/experience/) 
paying a CS 2nd year undergraduate to work on a program for wildfire detection.

* Co-supervising PhD students?

#### Possible research directions

* Applications of [CS-maths in SC](state-of-the-art.md) (interdisciplinary projects can be theoretical)

* [Machine Ethics](machine-ethics.md)

* The [Blockchain](blockchain-smart-contracts.md)
