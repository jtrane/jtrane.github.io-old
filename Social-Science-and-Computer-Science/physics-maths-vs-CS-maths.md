# Physics-maths vs CS-maths

There is an overlap, but physics maths emphasises more linear algebra and calculus and computer science maths emphasises logic, discrete maths, computability and complexity theory. 

(A good example is that "complexity" means sth different in physics-maths and in CS-maths.)

Physiscs-maths is much more important and successful in SC than CS-maths. But CS-maths has developed an important body of methods and results over the last 60 or so years.

Timely challenge: **Explore possibilities of CS-maths in SC**

Of course, this dichotomy is too simple. It would be interesting to have a discussion about what the term [formal methods](formal-methods) mean to SC.
