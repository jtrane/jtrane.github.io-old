# SC and CS

*More and more of society is based on digital data.* Its study needs methods from CS. (Example: Social media, Wikipedia, the Bitcoin blockchain, ...)

*Topics such as democracy, voting, censorship, privacy, etc benefit from technical CS knowledge.* (Example: [astroturfing](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/feb/23/need-to-protect-internet-from-astroturfing), [reverse censorship](http://gking.harvard.edu/50c), persona management software, ...)

*Socio-technical systems*: Software systems cannot be designed anymore without designing how they embed in society.  (Example: [online courts](http://www.legalfutures.co.uk/latest-news/briggs-lays-out-vision-for-lawyer-free-online-courts), ...)

*The internet and the cloud are not engineered.* Classical Software Engineering methods are not sufficient to study them.

*Programmed societies or societies of autonomous agents* will play an important part of our future (ubiquitous computing, internet-of-things, ...).
