# Agent based modelling (ABM)

Agent-based modeling is as old as computer science and a well established methodology in all (?) areas of SC. It has its own programming languages (Swarm, NetLogo, ...) and is too big an area to say much about here. Just two references:

A closely related research direction, adding to ABM a new focus on big data, is

### Computational Social Science

The [Computational Social Science Society of the Americas (CSSSA)](https://computationalsocialscience.org/) runs a conference series since 2011 dedicated to social simulation (agent-based modelling), social network analysis, and social media analysis. 

There is also the International Conference on
Computational Social Science, see eg [ICCSS 2015](http://www.iccss2015.eu/) and  [ICCSS 2016](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news-events/conference/ic2s2/2016.aspx).
